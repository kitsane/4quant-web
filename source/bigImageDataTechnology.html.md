# Lightning fast Geoimaging Analytics for informed business decisions

### 4Quant solutions provide insightful information from big data satellite and aerial imagery in a split second.

A key pain point of today’s image analysis that it involves mostly manual work.
A good example is that labels of structures on satellite images and maps,
such as buildings or streets, are assigned manually.
Consequently, most of a company’s image material cannot be used or companies
do not use images in their routine business processes overall.

Our image query and analysis engine provides access to arbitrarily scalable storage
and processing infrastructure for any kind of geoimage information.
Our proprietary image query language allows segmentation of dynamic features in aerial
and satellite images with unprecedented speed, allowing for both,
batch processing of huge image datasets and real-time video analysis.
