# Big Image Data Technology

## Querying images as easy as any other data

A key pain point of today’s image analysis that it involves mostly manual work. A good example is that labels of structures on satellite images and maps, such as buildings or streets, are assigned manually. Consequently, most of a company’s image material cannot be used or companies do not use images in their routine business processes overall.

Our image query and analysis engine provides access to arbitrarily scalable storage and processing infrastructure for any kind of geoimage information. Our proprietary image query language allows segmentation of dynamic features in aerial and satellite images with unprecedented speed, allowing for both, batch processing of huge image datasets and real-time video analysis.
