## Real-time severe weather analytics supports the valuation of weather-bound catastrophe bonds and thus the market expansion for insurance risk hedging.

Insurance companies make increasing use of catastrophe bonds (or CAT bonds) to transfer insurance risk to capital markets. Unlike traditional reinsurance, CAT bonds can be traded on a secondary market, exhibiting characteristics typically associated with fixed income securities, such as duration, discount margin and yield to maturity. This market implies calculating a market value of the bonds, however, existing models of the market price of cat bonds are often overly exotic or too simplistic.

Better pricing models can be obtained for instance through measurement of ambient parameters, such as atmospheric pressure within a storm. Any CAT bond linked to catastrophes triggered by this storm benefits from better and earlier estimation of the storm’s future evolution, e.g. its force development and the projection of movement. 4Quant facilitates such analysis through real-time satellite image processing coupled with advanced storm classification algorithms. Such analyses open up completely new models of CAT trading, such as “live cats”:

Imagine a storm growing on its way towards Florida, and it looks as though it will maintain its track and strength. In this scenario the probability of loss – triggering a payout on the bond – would rise. This would drop the price of a CAT bond and increase its spread, which is a profit measure for investors. If conditions change – either as the storm diverts into open water or it loses strength – and thereby averting a loss, the price would rebound and the spread would decrease again. Trading of catastrophe bonds as a potential event is unfolding (e.g. a storm is approaching the U.S. coastline) is often referred to as "live cat" trading. Live cats require instant information about event probabilities to facilitate pricing, thus it is only possible because there is a secondary market for CAT bonds and because of the continuous improvement of advanced storm prediction technology such as of 4Quant.
