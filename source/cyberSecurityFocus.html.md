# Cyber Security Focus

## Inherent image data security

We recognize that companies opt against cloud solutions due to raised data protection requirements. In certain sectors, such as insurance and financial services, even legal prerequisites exist that require client data storage and processing within the company’s jurisdiction. Simultaneously, companies do not see a business case in investing in additional own data processing infrastructure.

In everything we do, we lay special focus on seuring our customers' and their clients' data. 4Quant introduced the SecureImageData® Framework, which exhibits a general approac to data protection in industrial scale image analysis. An inherent property of our Image Query and Analysis Engine is the operation in computers' fugitive RAM, avoiding wherever possible storing data to disk and therby exposing data to intruders. In the layer ahead of this Engine, our Framework separates crucial from uncritical information and decides on the optimal allocation of computation hardware based on data security considerations.
