## Helping insurers to optimal allocate assets based on image intelligence at the very location of events

Insurers allocate resources to claims management after incidents. For instance, if a city is hit by a flood, insurers must estimate the damage and, based on their contracts, estimate which sum will be claimed by clients in days and weeks to come. Capital in height of this sum has to be set reserved for paying out clients, and such, the capital cannot be invested in long-term financial instruments. Insurers are naturally interested to estimate the damage as precisely and as early as possible. If the damage is estimated too high, an insurer faces opportunity cost of reserved resources that otherwise could have been invested. On the other hand, if the damage is estimated too low, an insurer has to liquify long-term financial engagements in order to pay out claims, which may be expensive.

4Quant is able to deliver in-time and precise information about expected damages in case of events such as floods, fire, storm, or hail. Based on close to real time analytics from images taken directly from the affected assets, e.g. by drones, insurers obtain exclusive information to feed into the own damage models and claims management system. Insurers are thus benefiting from improved asset allocation, directly affecting the companyâ€™s bottom line.
