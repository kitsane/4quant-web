## Teaching image analysis to the Internet of Things

Today, only a handful of specific industries use significant amounts of geospatial imagery. Reasons for sparse employment of image data in operations are limited accessibility, limited analysis capabilities for specialized business applications, and lack of strategic attention as image data was traditionally out of corporate business focus.

Our goal is to make every industry benefit from geoimagery information. To this end, we created a general analysis framework that allows for integration of various applications into any given business environment. Explore our examples of enrichment of existing web cam information with dynamic information from satellite imagery and the surveillance of construction sites by mapping architectural information into satellite images.
